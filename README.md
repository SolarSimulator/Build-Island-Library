# Blackfire's Build Island Library
A bunch of functions and stuff you can use to make scripts for Build Island!

Load it with:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolarSimulator/Build-Island-Library/refs/heads/main/main.lua'))()
```

# Functions:

```lua
GetRank(Player: Player)
```
Returns the rank of a player. Player defaults to LocalPlayer.


```lua
GetBuildingArea(Player: Player)
```
Returns the BuildingArea belonging to a player (CAN RETURN NIL). Player defaults to LocalPlayer.


```lua
Stamp(Block: string/number, Position: CFrame/Vector3, Size: Vector3): Model
```
-# Places a block at a set position with a set size. Also returns the block.
- Block: Can either be a block's name or a block's AssetId
- Position: The CFrame the block will be placed at. If it's a Vector3, it will turn it into a CFrame.
- Size: The size of the block
- 

```lua
Save()
```
Sets all your blocks information as Stamp(), Paint(), and Config() functions to your clipboard. This does not save wiring.
